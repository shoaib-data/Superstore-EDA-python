# 📌Superstore EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a retail sales dataset to uncover insights about sales performance, profit trends, and customer purchasing patterns.


## 🧠 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to explore the dataset, handle missing and duplicate values, and visualize meaningful business insights using Python and Seaborn.

### Key Objectives:
- Perform **data cleaning** (remove duplicates, handle null values)
- Explore sales and profit distribution across categories and regions
- Identify **top-performing** and **low-performing** areas
- Build clear **visualizations** to communicate insights


## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook



## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps
1. Checked for null and duplicate records  
2. Handled missing values using imputation or removal  
3. Verified data consistency (e.g., date format, numeric columns)  
4. Removed duplicate rows to maintain accuracy  


## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

### Key Visualizations:
- **Sales by Category** – Identify top-performing product segments  
- **Profit by Region** – Regional performance comparison  
- **Monthly Sales Trend** – Seasonal patterns in revenue  
- **Sub-Category Performance** – Profitability and contribution  


## 💡 Insights

1. **Furniture** and **Office Supplies** categories generated the highest sales, reflecting customer focus on essential products.  
2. **South** and **West** regions showed the best profit margins.  
3. **Sales increased during Month 4**, indicating a festive or target-driven boost
4. **Sales decreased during Month 8**, indicating seasonal demand changes
5. Cleaning null values and duplicates improved data quality and reliability.


## 🧾 Dataset
- **Name:** Superstore Sales Dataset (with nulls & duplicates for cleaning)
- **Size:** ~250 rows
- **Fields:** Order Date, Category, Sub-Category, Region, Sales, Profit
